Prints elements with those have same index as their values (Index/s i such that a[ i ] = i) using recursion


Given an array a[ ] of N distinct integers (positive or negative) in ascending order, devise an algorithm 
to find an index i such that a[ i ] = i if it exists. Hint: Use a recursive algorithm to solve the problem.
Implement your algorithm using Java which takes n elements integer array as user input and displays 
the correct output. You can assume the input is always in ascending order.
